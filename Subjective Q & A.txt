Question 1 
What is the optimal value of alpha for ridge and lasso regression? What will be the changes in the model if you choose double the value of alpha for both ridge and lasso? What will be the most important predictor variables after the change is implemented? 

 Optimal value of alpha for ridge is 2 and lasso is 0.001. 

Even after doubling the R2 score and MSE drop by 1% but overall the R2 score remains greater than 80%. [Refer the details towards end of the jupyter notebook] 

Question 2 
You have determined the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression during the assignment. Now, which one will you choose to apply and why? 

 Both Lasso and Ridge model have the similar values. But preference would be lasso as it reduce co efficient to zero hence reduce the feature dependancy in model. 

  

Question 3 
After building the model, you realised that the five most important predictor variables in the lasso model are not available in the incoming data. You will now have to create another model excluding the five most important predictor variables. Which are the five most important predictor variables now? 

  

Question 4 
How can you make sure that a model is robust and generalisable? What are the implications of the same for the accuracy of the model and why? 

We can make model robut and generalisable by making them simple as per Occamâ€™s Razor principle. 

Accurancy is a trade off between bias and variance. Simple models are more biased but complex models have high variance. So we need to chose a model accordingly.
